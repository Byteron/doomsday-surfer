Our last resistance is in Island \"SRC0451\",
a secret scientific and military base, where humanity labs managed to replicate ENIMGAII's Kaiju engineering process and created \"Crimson Danger\" the plant kaiju defender of humanity, but that's not enough, the last power collector on the island need to collect energy to maintain the habitat system and to aid the Kaiju in battle, the survivor dont have much to do in the middle of a climatic catastrophe they just run and help if its not risky, and lastly our hero a surfer with some kind of tribal ideology that believes that riding the catastrophe he can tame it...

Let humanity survive one more day..

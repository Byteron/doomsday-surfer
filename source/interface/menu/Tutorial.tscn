You are in control of 4 units, to select a unit click over it, once selected click where you want to move it.

GOAL:

Each unit has a goal to accomplish and some skill but the ultimate goal of the game is survive until the surfer catches the wave break point (red percentage bar in the top right).

UNITS:

Doomsday Surfer: Keep it in a quadrant to stop disasters from growing, but we aware after some time the surfer need to go to another quadrant. When the surfer stop a quadrant grow you can put a unit together with him if is a tile available to keep it secure for a while.

Power Collector: This machine purpose is to collect energy cells, once the energy bar (in the left) is complete a random quadrant of the map will be cleaned of all disaster. This unit should be the one that moves more.

Survivors: Poor guys just want to eat, collect food before the hunger bar on the right fills completely.

Plant Kaiju aka \"Crimson Danger\": Move it over an enemy kaiju to kill it, an enemy kaiju will spawn and move randomly in the map, his next destination is marked with a red cross.

We aware thar disasters are constantly growing buy you can stay in that tile until the disaster appears completly.

Be fast. Think Fast, Click fast."

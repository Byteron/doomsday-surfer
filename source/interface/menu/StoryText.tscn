After the super computer \"ENIGMA II\" took control of all processing power on earth, humanity is at the brink of extinction. It created a cascade effect with the spatial debris on earth' orbit. Raining fire ended more than half of humanity's lives. \"ENIGMA II\" infiltrated all the climate control machines and bioengineered kaijus to hunt the rest of the survivors.

Our last resistance is on an island called \"SRC0451\", A secret scientific military base. Humanity managed to replicate \"ENIMGA II\"'s kaiju engineering process and created \"Crimson Danger\", the plant kaiju defender of humanity. But that's not enough; the last power collector on the island needs to collect energy to maintain the habitat system and to aid the Kaiju in battle. The survivors don't have much to do in the middle of a climatic catastrophe, they just run and help if its not risky. Lastly, our hero... a surfer with some kind of tribal ideology that believes that riding the catastrophe he can tame it...

Let humanity survive one more day!
